# PlayerJAVA
Simple Java-based player app for playing DMX recordings made with the DMX Recorder app with audio. The app simply plays the show ASAP after being started. Use a terminal script or system scheduler to create and schedule shows. This app is intended to allow users of the DMX Recorder app to play shows on non-Windows platforms. In my testing, I was able to run a show on macOS ARM64 with a .WAV audio file.

# Instructions

## Setup
- Download and install the official Java runtime on your device. I developed this with version 20. 
- Download the bin/App.class file from this repository to your device.
- From the terminal or console, navigate the folder containing the App.class file.
  - It is easiest to place the App.class file and all of your DMX and audio files in the same folder.

## Playback
This example assumes your terminal is open to the folder where the App.class file is stored.

From the terminal prompt:
```
java App [path of .DMX file] [IP Address] [Optional: Audio file]
```
```
java App Bells.dmx 192.168.1.255 Bells.wav
```

As with the Windows app, you can unicast to a single IP address by entering the device's IP address. You can broadcast by replacing the last number in the IP address with 255. For example, 192.168.1.15 is a unicast address. 192.168.1.255 will broadcast to all devices on whose address starts with 192.168.1.*** .

## Schedules and Automation
Since this app runs with terminal commands, you can use a schduling tool or script to fire off the commands in sequences, loops, and at certian times. Look to Google for examples on how to scheulde tasks and make terminal scrips for your platform.
